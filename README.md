# mcc.py

A Python module for controlling Minecraft Console Client Webhook bots

## Design

Designed based on [MCC.JS](https://github.com/milutinke/MCC.js)

## EXPERIMENTAL

This library is currently purely experimental, as it relies on experimental
features of Minecraft Console Client. It may break with no warning due to
changes that are not under the control of the maintainer.

My main goal is to play with the technologies and ideas, so this repo may not
be maintained in hte future.

## Commands

To save time the command are auto generated from the Minecraft-Console-Client docs,
using `generate_commands.py`.
